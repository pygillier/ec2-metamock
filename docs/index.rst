metamock, a local EC2 meta-data service
=======================================

**Metamock** helps you write and tests applications relying on `EC2 metadata service <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-metadata.html>`_ without having to deploy you code on a real EC2 instance. 

You can use it directly in your favorite virtualenv manager or by using the docker image (soon).
